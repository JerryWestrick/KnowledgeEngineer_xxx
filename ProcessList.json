User Interface\n- The client must prompt the user for a username upon starting.\n- It should display the game board, a frame around the board, and a status bar for the client list.\n\n## 4. Game Board Display\n- The game board must be a 2D 100x100 character array with a default character of \" \".\n- The board should be resizable, and characters should scale with the board size.\n\n## 5. Client List Display\n- The client list must be displayed in a status bar at the bottom of the window.\n- It should show each client's character, username, and score in the format \"{char}{username}:{score} \".\n\n## 6. User Interaction\n- The client must detect arrow key presses to change the direction of the snake.\n- It should send the appropriate \"DirectionChange\" message to the server when an arrow key is pressed.\n\n## 7.

Error Handling\n- The client must handle network errors and disconnections gracefully.\n- It should attempt to reconnect or inform the user of the issue.\n\n## 9. Visual and Aesthetic Elements\n- The client should have a visually appealing design for the game board and status bar.\n- It must ensure that the game elements are clearly visible and distinguishable.\n\n## 10. Responsiveness\n- The client must be responsive and work on various screen sizes and devices.\n- It should maintain functionality and appearance across different browsers.\n\n## 11. Client Initialization\n- The client must initialize the connection to the server and handle the joining process.\n- It should manage the initial setup, including sending the \"Joining\" message with the username.\n\n## 12. Client-Side Logic\n- The client should implement any necessary logic to display the game state correctly.\n- It must not implement game rules or mechanics, as these are handled by the server.\n\n## 13. Accessibility\n- The client should be accessible, with considerations for users with disabilities.\n- It must follow best practices for web accessibility where applicable."
