The player controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, right) and the snake's body follows.\\n3. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.\\n4. The game ends if the snake hits the wall, an obstacle, or itself.\\n5. The speed of the snake may increase as the game progresses, raising the difficulty.\\n6. The player cannot stop the snake's movement or move in the opposite direction of the snake's current movement.\\n7. The game may include different levels or areas, each with its own set of obstacles or challenges.\\n8. Points are awarded for each piece of food the snake consumes, and sometimes bonus items appear for extra points.\\n\\n## User Interface/Interactions\\n\\n- Arrow keys or swipe gestures are typically used to control the direction of the snake.\\n- The game starts with a menu where the player can start the game, check high scores, or access settings.\\n- During gameplay, the score is usually displayed on the screen, representing the number of food items consumed.\\n- Some versions of the game may allow the player to pause and resume the game.\\n- Sound effects and music may accompany the gameplay, with options to mute.\\n- The game over screen presents the player's score and may offer the option to restart the game or return to the main menu.\\n- In some versions, there may be power-ups or special items that can affect gameplay, such as slowing down the snake or making it invincible for a short period.\"}"

Architecture\\n\\nThe server side of the multi-user 'Snake' online game will be implemented in Python 3 using Async IO and aiohttp to serve the SnakeClient.html file and connect via websockets.\\n\\n2. Game Board\\n\\nThe server will maintain a 100x100 2D character representation of the playing ground called the game_board. The game_board will be updated with the values of snakes and foods. Collisions can be checked by examining the character value in the game_board at a specific position.\\n\\n3. Ticks Logic\\n\\nThe game will be implemented using ticks, with 5 ticks per second. Each tick will perform the following actions:\\n\\n- Move each snake whose direction is not 'Stop'. If the new head position is out of bounds or collides with another snake, the snake dies.\\n- If the new head position contains a food, the snake eats it, increases its score, and a new food is randomly placed on the game_board.\\n- If the new head position is empty, the snake moves to the new position and its tail is updated.\\n- The updated game status is sent to all connected clients.\\n\\n4. Snake Dies\\n\\nWhen a snake dies, the server sends a SnakeDied message to the client, erases the client's snake from the game_board, and performs a reset for the client.\\n\\n5. Reset A Client\\n\\nWhen resetting a client, a new snake head is randomly positioned on the game_board, the client's snake is updated, the client's score is set to zero, and the client's direction is set to 'Stop'.\\n\\n6. Joining\\n\\nWhen a client sends a 'Joining' message, the server assigns a free snake character to the client, sets the client's username, and performs a reset for the client. If there are no free snake characters available, the server closes the websocket connection.\\n\\n7. Websocket Disconnect\\n\\nWhen a websocket disconnects, the server returns the client's snake character to the pool of free snake characters, erases the client's snake from the game_board, and removes the client from the game_status.\\n\\n8.

Single HTML File\n- The client must be contained within a single HTML file, named SnakeClient.html.\n- This file should include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript necessary for the game.\n\n## 2. WebSockets Communication\n- The client must use WebSockets to communicate with the server in real-time.\n- It should handle messages such as \"Joining\", \"DirectionChange\", \"SnakeDied\", and \"GameStatus\".\n\n## 3. User Interface\n- The client must prompt the user for a username upon starting.\n- It should display the game board, a frame around the board, and a status bar for the client list.\n\n## 4. Game Board Display\n- The game board must be a 2D 100x100 character array with a default character of \" \".\n- The board should be resizable, and characters should scale with the board size.\n\n## 5. Client List Display\n- The client list must be displayed in a status bar at the bottom of the window.\n- It should show each client's character, username, and score in the format \"{char}{username}:{score} \".\n\n## 6. User Interaction\n- The client must detect arrow key presses to change the direction of the snake.\n- It should send the appropriate \"DirectionChange\" message to the server when an arrow key is pressed.\n\n## 7. Handling Server Messages\n- The client must update the game board and client list based on the \"GameStatus\" message from the server.\n- It should display a pop-up dialog when the \"SnakeDied\" message is received.\n\n## 8. Error Handling\n- The client must handle network errors and disconnections gracefully.\n- It should attempt to reconnect or inform the user of the issue.\n\n## 9. Visual and Aesthetic Elements\n- The client should have a visually appealing design for the game board and status bar.\n- It must ensure that the game elements are clearly visible and distinguishable.\n\n## 10. Responsiveness\n- The client must be responsive and work on various screen sizes and devices.\n- It should maintain functionality and appearance across different browsers.\n\n## 11. Client Initialization\n- The client must initialize the connection to the server and handle the joining process.\n- It should manage the initial setup, including sending the \"Joining\" message with the username.\n\n## 12. Client-Side Logic\n- The client should implement any necessary logic to display the game state correctly.\n- It must not implement game rules or mechanics, as these are handled by the server.\n\n## 13. Accessibility\n- The client should be accessible, with considerations for users with disabilities.\n- It must follow best practices for web accessibility where applicable."

The game ends when the snake either runs into the screen border, an obstacle, or itself.\\n\\n## Game Rules\\n\\n1. The snake moves continuously in the direction it is headed.\\n2. The player controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, right) and the snake's body follows.\\n3. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.\\n4. The game ends if the snake hits the wall, an obstacle, or itself.\\n5. The speed of the snake may increase as the game progresses, raising the difficulty.\\n6. The player cannot stop the snake's movement or move in the opposite direction of the snake's current movement.\\n7. The game may include different levels or areas, each with its own set of obstacles or challenges.\\n\\n## User Interface/Interactions\\n\\n- Arrow keys or swipe gestures are typically used to control the direction of the snake.\\n- The game starts with a menu where the player can start the game, check high scores, or access settings.\\n- During gameplay, the score is usually displayed on the screen, representing the number of food items consumed.\\n- Some versions of the game may allow the player to pause and resume the game.\\n- Sound effects and music may accompany the gameplay, with options to mute.\\n- The game over screen presents the player's score and may offer the option to restart the game or return to the main menu.\"\n}"

The player controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, right) and the snake's body follows.\n3. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.\n4. The game ends if the snake hits the wall, an obstacle, or itself.\n5. The speed of the snake may increase as the game progresses, raising the difficulty.\n6. The player cannot stop the snake's movement or move in the opposite direction of the snake's current movement.\n7. The game may include different levels or areas, each with its own set of obstacles or challenges.\n\n## User Interface/Interactions\n\n- Arrow keys or swipe gestures are typically used to control the direction of the snake.\n- The game starts with a menu where the player can start the game, check high scores, or access settings.\n- During gameplay, the score is usually displayed on the screen, representing the number of food items consumed.\n- Some versions of the game may allow the player to pause and resume the game.\n- Sound effects and music may accompany the gameplay, with options to mute.\n- The game over screen presents the player's score and may offer the option to restart the game or return to the main menu."
