Single HTML File\n- The client must be contained within a single HTML file, named SnakeClient.html.\n- This file should include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript necessary for the game.\n\n## 2. WebSockets Communication\n- The client must use WebSockets to communicate with the server in real-time.\n- It should handle messages such as \"Joining\", \"DirectionChange\", \"SnakeDied\", and \"GameStatus\".\n\n## 3. User Interface\n- The client must prompt the user for a username upon starting.\n- It should display the game board, a frame around the board, and a status bar for the client list.\n\n## 4. Game Board Display\n- The game board must be a 2D 100x100 character array with a default character of \" \".\n- The board should be resizable, and characters should scale with the board size.\n\n## 5. Client List Display\n- The client list must be displayed in a status bar at the bottom of the window.\n- It should show each client's character, username, and score in the format \"{char}{username}:{score} \".\n\n## 6. User Interaction\n- The client must detect arrow key presses to change the direction of the snake.\n- It should send the appropriate \"DirectionChange\" message to the server when an arrow key is pressed.\n\n## 7. Handling Server Messages\n- The client must update the game board and client list based on the \"GameStatus\" message from the server.\n- It should display a pop-up dialog when the \"SnakeDied\" message is received.\n\n## 8. Error Handling\n- The client must handle network errors and disconnections gracefully.\n- It should attempt to reconnect or inform the user of the issue.\n\n## 9. Visual and Aesthetic Elements\n- The client should have a visually appealing design for the game board and status bar.\n- It must ensure that the game elements are clearly visible and distinguishable.\n\n## 10. Responsiveness\n- The client must be responsive and work on various screen sizes and devices.\n- It should maintain functionality and appearance across different browsers.\n\n## 11. Client Initialization\n- The client must initialize the connection to the server and handle the joining process.\n- It should manage the initial setup, including sending the \"Joining\" message with the username.\n\n## 12. Client-Side Logic\n- The client should implement any necessary logic to display the game state correctly.\n- It must not implement game rules or mechanics, as these are handled by the server.\n\n## 13. Accessibility\n- The client should be accessible, with considerations for users with disabilities.\n- It must follow best practices for web accessibility where applicable."

Game Board\\n\\nThe server will maintain a 100x100 2D character representation of the playing ground called the game_board. The game_board will be updated with the values of snakes and foods. Collisions can be checked by examining the character value in the game_board at a specific position.\\n\\n3. Ticks Logic\\n\\nThe game will be implemented using ticks, with 5 ticks per second. Each tick will perform the following actions:\\n\\n- Move each snake whose direction is not 'Stop'. If the new head position is out of bounds or collides with another snake, the snake dies.\\n- If the new head position contains a food, the snake eats it, increases its score, and a new food is randomly placed on the game_board.\\n- If the new head position is empty, the snake moves to the new position and its tail is updated.\\n- The updated game status is sent to all connected clients.\\n\\n4. Snake Dies\\n\\nWhen a snake dies, the server sends a SnakeDied message to the client, erases the client's snake from the game_board, and performs a reset for the client.\\n\\n5. Reset A Client\\n\\nWhen resetting a client, a new snake head is randomly positioned on the game_board, the client's snake is updated, the client's score is set to zero, and the client's direction is set to 'Stop'.\\n\\n6. Joining\\n\\nWhen a client sends a 'Joining' message, the server assigns a free snake character to the client, sets the client's username, and performs a reset for the client. If there are no free snake characters available, the server closes the websocket connection.\\n\\n7. Websocket Disconnect\\n\\nWhen a websocket disconnects, the server returns the client's snake character to the pool of free snake characters, erases the client's snake from the game_board, and removes the client from the game_status.\\n\\n8.

Single HTML File\n- The client must be contained within a single HTML file, named SnakeClient.html.\n- This file should include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript necessary for the game.\n\n## 2. WebSockets Communication\n- The client must use WebSockets to communicate with the server in real-time.\n- It should handle messages such as \"Joining\", \"DirectionChange\", \"SnakeDied\", and \"GameStatus\".\n\n## 3. User Interface\n- The client must prompt the user for a username upon starting.\n- It should display the game board, a frame around the board, and a status bar for the client list.\n\n## 4. Game Board Display\n- The game board must be a 2D 100x100 character array with a default character of \" \".\n- The board should be resizable, and characters should scale with the board size.\n\n## 5. Client List Display\n- The client list must be displayed in a status bar at the bottom of the window.\n- It should show each client's character, username, and score in the format \"{char}{username}:{score} \".\n\n## 6. User Interaction\n- The client must detect arrow key presses to change the direction of the snake.\n- It should send the appropriate \"DirectionChange\" message to the server when an arrow key is pressed.\n\n## 7. Handling Server Messages\n- The client must update the game board and client list based on the \"GameStatus\" message from the server.\n- It should display a pop-up dialog when the \"SnakeDied\" message is received.\n\n## 8. Error Handling\n- The client must handle network errors and disconnections gracefully.\n- It should attempt to reconnect or inform the user of the issue.\n\n## 9. Visual and Aesthetic Elements\n- The client should have a visually appealing design for the game board and status bar.\n- It must ensure that the game elements are clearly visible and distinguishable.\n\n## 10. Responsiveness\n- The client must be responsive and work on various screen sizes and devices.\n- It should maintain functionality and appearance across different browsers.\n\n## 11. Client Initialization\n- The client must initialize the connection to the server and handle the joining process.\n- It should manage the initial setup, including sending the \"Joining\" message with the username.\n\n## 12. Client-Side Logic\n- The client should implement any necessary logic to display the game state correctly.\n- It must not implement game rules or mechanics, as these are handled by the server.\n\n## 13. Accessibility\n- The client should be accessible, with considerations for users with disabilities.\n- It must follow best practices for web accessibility where applicable."
