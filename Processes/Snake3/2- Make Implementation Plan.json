        "content": "# Snake Game Description\n\nThe Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a line, which grows in length, called the 'snake'. The main objective of the game is to navigate the snake around the playing area while consuming food items to grow in length. The game ends when the snake either runs into the screen border, an obstacle, or itself.\n\n## Game Rules\n\n1. The snake moves continuously in the direction it is headed.\n2. The player controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, right) and the snake's body follows.\n3. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.\n4. The game ends if the snake hits the wall, an obstacle, or itself.\n5. The speed of the snake may increase as the game progresses, raising the difficulty.\n6. The player cannot stop the snake's movement or move in the opposite direction of the snake's current movement.\n7. The game may include different levels or areas, each with its own set of obstacles or challenges.\n8. Points are awarded for each piece of food the snake consumes, and sometimes bonus items appear for extra points.\n\n## User Interface/Interactions\n\n- Arrow keys or swipe gestures are typically used to control the direction of the snake.\n- The game starts with a menu where the player can start the game, check high scores, or access settings.\n- During gameplay, the score is usually displayed on the screen, representing the number of food items consumed.\n- Some versions of the game may allow the player to pause and resume the game.\n- Sound effects and music may accompany the gameplay, with options to mute.\n- The game over screen presents the player's score and may offer the option to restart the game or return to the main menu.\n- In some versions, there may be power-ups or special items that can affect gameplay, such as slowing down the snake or making it invincible for a short period."
