Architecture\\n\\nThe server side of the multi-user 'Snake' online game will be implemented in Python 3 using Async IO and aiohttp to serve the SnakeClient.html file and connect via websockets.\\n\\n2. Game Board\\n\\nThe server will maintain a 100x100 2D character representation of the playing ground called the game_board. The game_board will be updated with the values of snakes and foods. Collisions can be checked by examining the character value in the game_board at a specific position.\\n\\n3. Ticks Logic\\n\\nThe game will be implemented using ticks, with 5 ticks per second. Each tick will perform the following actions:\\n\\n- Move each snake whose direction is not 'Stop'. If the new head position is out of bounds or collides with another snake, the snake dies.\\n- If the new head position contains a food, the snake eats it, increases its score, and a new food is randomly placed on the game_board.\\n- If the new head position is empty, the snake moves to the new position and its tail is updated.\\n- The updated game status is sent to all connected clients.\\n\\n4. Snake Dies\\n\\nWhen a snake dies, the server sends a SnakeDied message to the client, erases the client's snake from the game_board, and performs a reset for the client.\\n\\n5. Reset A Client\\n\\nWhen resetting a client, a new snake head is randomly positioned on the game_board, the client's snake is updated, the client's score is set to zero, and the client's direction is set to 'Stop'.\\n\\n6. Joining\\n\\nWhen a client sends a 'Joining' message, the server assigns a free snake character to the client, sets the client's username, and performs a reset for the client. If there are no free snake characters available, the server closes the websocket connection.\\n\\n7. Websocket Disconnect\\n\\nWhen a websocket disconnects, the server returns the client's snake character to the pool of free snake characters, erases the client's snake from the game_board, and removes the client from the game_status.\\n\\n8. Startup\\n\\nAt startup, the server starts an HTTP server to serve the SnakeClient.html file.\\n\"\n}"
