# Server Requirements for Snake Online Game

## Detailed Description of Each Requirement

### 1. Python 3 and Async IO
- The server must be implemented using Python 3.
- It should utilize asynchronous I/O operations to handle multiple client connections efficiently.

### 2. aiohttp Web Server
- The server should use the aiohttp library to serve the SnakeClient.html file.
- It must handle websocket connections for real-time communication with clients.

### 3. Game Board Management
- The server must maintain a 100x100 2D character array representing the game board.
- It should update the game board with the positions of snakes and food items.
- Collision detection will be based on the character values in the game board.

### 4. Game Ticks
- The server should implement game logic in ticks, with 5 ticks per second.
- Each tick involves moving snakes, handling collisions, and updating scores.

### 5. Client Management
- The server must manage client connections, including joining, disconnecting, and resetting clients.
- It should assign characters to clients and handle the allocation and deallocation of these characters.

### 6. Scoring and Game Progression
- The server must track and update scores for each client.
- It should handle the spawning of new food items and the death of snakes.

### 7. Communication with Clients
- The server must send updated GameStatus to all connected clients each tick.
- It should handle incoming messages such as 'Joining', 'DirectionChange', and websocket disconnections.

### 8. HTTP Server at Startup
- At startup, the server should start an HTTP server to serve the SnakeClient.html file to clients.

### 9. Error Handling and Validation
- The server must include error handling to manage unexpected situations and invalid client requests.

### 10. Security Considerations
- The server should implement security measures to prevent cheating and ensure fair play.

### 11. Logging and Monitoring
- The server should have logging capabilities to monitor game activity and troubleshoot issues.

### 12. Resource Management
- The server must efficiently manage resources to handle the game's demands without performance degradation.

### 13. Extensibility and Maintenance
- The server code should be written in a way that allows for easy maintenance and extensibility for future features or changes.
