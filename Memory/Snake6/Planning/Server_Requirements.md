# Server Requirements for Snake Online Game

## Detailed Description of Each Requirement

### 1. Python 3 with Async IO
- The server must be implemented using Python 3.
- It should utilize asynchronous I/O operations to handle multiple client connections efficiently.

### 2. aiohttp for Serving HTML and WebSockets
- The server should use the aiohttp library to serve the SnakeClient.html file.
- It must handle WebSocket connections for real-time communication with clients.

### 3. Game Board Management
- The server must maintain a 100x100 2D character array representing the game board.
- It should update the game board with the positions of snakes and food items.
- Collision detection will be based on the character values in the game board.

### 4. Game Ticks
- The server should implement game logic in ticks, with 5 ticks per second.
- Each tick involves moving snakes, handling collisions, and updating scores.

### 5. Client Management
- The server must manage client connections, including joining, disconnecting, and resetting clients.
- It should assign characters to clients and handle the allocation and deallocation of these characters.

### 6. Score and Death Handling
- The server must update client scores based on game events.
- It should send appropriate messages to clients when their snake dies and reset their game state.

### 7. Food Item Management
- The server should handle the placement and consumption of food items on the game board.
- It must ensure that new food items are placed in empty spaces.

### 8. HTTP Server at Startup
- At startup, the server must start an HTTP server to serve the SnakeClient.html file to clients.

### 9. Real-time Communication
- The server must send the updated GameStatus to all connected clients after each tick.

### 10. Error Handling
- The server should handle errors gracefully, including full client lists and unexpected disconnections.

### 11. Logging
- The server must implement logging to track game events and client activities.

These requirements ensure that the server can manage the game logic, client connections, and real-time updates efficiently and reliably.
