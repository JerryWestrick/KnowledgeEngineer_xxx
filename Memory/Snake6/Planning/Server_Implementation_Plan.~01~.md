  - Start the event loop.

## 2. aiohttp Web Server

### Function: `initialize_web_server`
- **Interface**: `async def initialize_web_server()`
- **Logic**:
  - Create an aiohttp web application.
  - Initialize the HTTP server for serving the `SnakeClient.html` file.
  - Set up routes to serve `SnakeClient.html`.
  - Run the web application on the event loop.

## 3. Websocket Support

### Function: `websocket_handler`
- **Interface**: `async def websocket_handler(request)`
- **Logic**:
  - Upgrade the HTTP request to a websocket connection.
  - Handle incoming websocket messages and delegate to appropriate functions.
  - Manage the lifecycle of the websocket connection, including handling disconnections.

## 4. Game Board Management

### Function: `update_game_board`
- **Interface**: `def update_game_board()`
- **Logic**:
  - Iterate over the game board and update the positions of snakes and food after each tick.
  - Check for collisions and update the game state accordingly.

## 5. Game Tick Logic

### Function: `process_game_tick`
- **Interface**: `async def process_game_tick()`
- **Logic**:
  - Schedule the next tick using `asyncio.sleep`.
  - Invoke functions to move snakes according to their directions.
  - Handle snake collisions and food consumption.
  - Update the game board.
  - Update scores and send the updated game status to clients.

## 6. Collision Detection

### Function: `check_collision`
- **Interface**: `def check_collision(position: tuple) -> bool`
- **Logic**:
  - Check if the given position collides with the boundaries, snakes, or food.
  - Return `True` if a collision is detected, `False` otherwise.

## 7. Snake Lifecycle Management

### Function: `manage_snake_lifecycle`
- **Interface**: `def manage_snake_lifecycle(client_id)`
- **Logic**:
  - Handle the creation, movement, and death of a client's snake.
  - Reset the snake when necessary, including handling the 'SnakeDied' message.

## 8. Food Management

### Function: `manage_food`
- **Interface**: `def manage_food()`
- **Logic**:
  - Place new food items on the game board when consumed.
  - Ensure that food is placed in an empty space.

## 9. Client Management

### Function: `manage_client`
- **Interface**: `async def manage_client(websocket)`
- **Logic**:
  - Handle client joining, including processing the "Joining" message and assigning a character.
  - Handle client disconnection.
  - Assign and reassign snake characters as needed.
  - Maintain the client list and their game state.

## 10. Score Tracking

### Function: `update_scores`
- **Interface**: `def update_scores(client_id, points: int)`
- **Logic**:
  - Update the score of the specified client by the given points.
  - Ensure that the score is accurately reflected in the game state.

## 11. Client Communication

### Function: `broadcast_game_status`
- **Interface**: `async def broadcast_game_status()`
- **Logic**:
  - Serialize the current game status into a JSON message.
  - Send the message to all connected clients via their websockets.

## 12. Error Handling

### Function: `handle_error`
- **Interface**: `def handle_error(error)`
- **Logic**:
  - Log the error.
  - Perform any necessary cleanup or state reset.

## 13. Resource Management

### Function: `manage_resources`
- **Interface**: `def manage_resources()`
- **Logic**:
  - Monitor and optimize the usage of game resources.
  - Ensure fair distribution and prevent resource starvation.

## 14. HTTP Server Startup

### Function: `serve_client_html`
- **Interface**: `async def serve_client_html(request)`
- **Logic**:
  - Serve the `SnakeClient.html` file in response to HTTP GET requests.

## 15. Client Character Assignment

### Function: `assign_client_character`
- **Interface**: `def assign_client_character(client_id)`
- **Logic**:
  - Assign a unique character to a new client from the available pool.
  - Update the game state to reflect the assignment.

## 16. Client Reset

### Function: `reset_client`
- **Interface**: `def reset_client(client_id)`
- **Logic**:
  - Reset the client's snake to a default state.
  - Place the snake in an empty space on the game board.

## 17. Client Username Handling

### Function: `handle_username`
- **Interface**: `def handle_username(client_id, username: str)`
- **Logic**:
  - Ensure the username is unique and associate it with the client's snake character.

## 18. Client Score Display

### Function: `display_client_scores`
- **Interface**: `def display_client_scores() -> str`
- **Logic**:
  - Create a string representation of the client list with characters, usernames, and scores.

## 19. Message Handling

### Function: `handle_message`
- **Interface**: `async def handle_message(websocket, message: dict)`
- **Logic**:
  - Parse the incoming message and handle different message types such as "Joining", "DirectionChange", and "SnakeDied" accordingly.

## 20. Security

### Function: `enforce_security`
- **Interface**: `def enforce_security()`
- **Logic**:
  - Implement measures to prevent cheating and unauthorized access.
  - Validate client messages and handle suspicious behavior.
