# Server Implementation Plan for Snake Online Game

This document outlines the implementation plan for the server of the Snake Online Game, mapping each requirement to functions with their interface and logic, including extensive documentation.

## Python 3 with Async IO (Requirement 1)

### Function: `start_server`
- **Interface**: `async def start_server(host: str, port: int)`
- **Logic**:
  - Initialize the server using `asyncio` and `aiohttp` libraries.
  - Set up routes for serving `SnakeClient.html` and handling WebSocket connections.
  - Start the server loop to listen for incoming connections on the specified host and port.

## aiohttp for Serving HTML and WebSockets (Requirement 2)

### Function: `serve_client_html`
- **Interface**: `async def serve_client_html(request)`
- **Logic**:
  - Serve the `SnakeClient.html` file to clients when they connect via HTTP.
  - This function will be registered as a route in the aiohttp application.

### Function: `websocket_handler`
- **Interface**: `async def websocket_handler(request)`
- **Logic**:
  - Establish a WebSocket connection with the client.
  - Handle incoming messages and delegate to appropriate functions based on message type.
  - Maintain the connection open for real-time communication.

## Game Board Management (Requirement 3)

### Function: `initialize_game_board`
- **Interface**: `def initialize_game_board() -> List[List[str]]`
- **Logic**:
  - Create a 100x100 2D list filled with spaces to represent the game board.
  - Return the initialized game board.

### Function: `update_game_board`
- **Interface**: `def update_game_board(game_board: List[List[str]], game_state: dict)`
- **Logic**:
  - Update the game board with the positions of snakes and food items based on the current game state.
  - Use the `SNAKE_CHARACTERS` and `FOOD_CHAR` constants for representation.

## Game Ticks (Requirement 4)

### Function: `game_tick`
- **Interface**: `async def game_tick(game_state: dict)`
- **Logic**:
  - Perform one tick of the game logic, including moving snakes and handling collisions.
  - Update the scores and game state accordingly.
  - Schedule the next tick using `asyncio` after a delay to maintain 5 ticks per second.

## Client Management (Requirement 5)

### Function: `handle_client_joining`
- **Interface**: `async def handle_client_joining(websocket, username: str, game_state: dict)`
- **Logic**:
  - Assign a character to the new client from the available characters.
  - Initialize the client's snake and add them to the game state.
  - If no characters are available, close the WebSocket connection.

### Function: `handle_client_disconnect`
- **Interface**: `async def handle_client_disconnect(websocket, game_state: dict)`
- **Logic**:
  - Remove the client from the game state and return their character to the pool of available characters.
  - Update the game board to remove the client's snake.

## Score and Death Handling (Requirement 6)

### Function: `handle_snake_death`
- **Interface**: `async def handle_snake_death(websocket, game_state: dict)`
- **Logic**:
  - Send a `SnakeDied` message to the client.
  - Reset the client's game state, including their score and snake position.

## Food Item Management (Requirement 7)

### Function: `place_food_items`
- **Interface**: `def place_food_items(game_board: List[List[str]], game_state: dict)`
- **Logic**:
  - Place `FOOD_COUNT` food items on the game board in empty spaces.
  - Update the game state with the positions of the new food items.

## HTTP Server at Startup (Requirement 8)

### Function: `run_http_server`
- **Interface**: `async def run_http_server(host: str, port: int)`
- **Logic**:
  - Start an HTTP server using `aiohttp` to serve `SnakeClient.html`.
  - This function will be called at server startup.

## Real-time Communication (Requirement 9)

### Function: `broadcast_game_status`
- **Interface**: `async def broadcast_game_status(game_state: dict)`
- **Logic**:
  - Send the updated `GameStatus` message to all connected clients after each tick.
  - Use the WebSocket connections stored in the game state to broadcast the message.

## Error Handling (Requirement 10)

### Function: `handle_errors`
- **Interface**: `async def handle_errors(websocket, error: Exception)`
- **Logic**:
  - Log the error and send an appropriate message to the client if necessary.
  - Handle disconnections and other exceptions gracefully.

## Logging (Requirement 11)

### Function: `log_event`
- **Interface**: `def log_event(event_type: str, details: str)`
- **Logic**:
  - Log game events and client activities to a file or standard output.
  - Include timestamps and relevant information for debugging and monitoring.

This plan provides a comprehensive guide for implementing the server-side logic of the Snake Online Game, ensuring that all requirements are met with well-defined functions and clear documentation.
