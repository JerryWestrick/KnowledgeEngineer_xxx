# Snake Game Description

The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a line, which grows in length, called the 'snake'. The main objective of the game is to navigate the snake around the playing area while consuming food items to grow in length. The game ends when the snake either runs into the screen border, an obstacle, or itself.

## Game Rules

1. The snake moves continuously in the direction it is headed.
2. The player controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, right) and the snake's body follows.
3. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.
4. The game ends if the snake hits the wall, an obstacle, or itself.
5. The speed of the snake may increase as the game progresses, raising the difficulty.
6. The player cannot stop the snake's movement or move in the opposite direction of the snake's current movement.
7. The game may include different levels or areas, each with its own set of obstacles or challenges.
8. Points are awarded for each piece of food the snake consumes, and sometimes bonus items appear for extra points.
