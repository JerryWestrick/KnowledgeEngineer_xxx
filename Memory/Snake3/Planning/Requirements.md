# Snake Game Description

The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a line, which grows in length, called the 'snake'. The main objective of the game is to navigate the snake to consume food, avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body, and survive as long as possible to achieve a high score.

## Game Rules

1. The snake moves continuously in the direction it is headed.
2. The player can change the direction of the snake's movement using the arrow keys.
3. When the snake eats a food item (represented by the 'üçé' character), it grows in length.
4. Each food item consumed increases the player's score.
5. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls of the game area or with its own body.
6. The speed of the snake may increase as the snake grows or as the game progresses, making the game more challenging.
7. The game starts with the snake at a minimal length and it grows with each food item consumed.
8. The game may feature levels or stages, each with increasing difficulty.
