# Snake Game Description

The Snake game is a classic arcade game that has been around since the late 1970s. The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the walls that surround the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.

## Game Rules

1. The snake moves continuously in the direction it is headed.
2. The player controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, right) and the snake's body follows.
3. The snake must avoid the walls and its own body.
4. Each time the snake consumes a piece of food, it grows in length.
5. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or its own body.
6. The speed of the snake may increase as it eats more food, making the game more challenging.
7. The goal is to grow the longest snake possible without colliding.
8. The game's difficulty can be adjusted by changing the size of the food items, the speed of the snake, or the size of the play area.
