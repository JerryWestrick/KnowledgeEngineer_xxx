Log of Step: 3- Implement Snake Program : Snake2/Prompts/3- Implement Snake Program.pe


 - The skeleton code for the Snake game has been created and saved in the file 'Snake2/Code/Snake.py'. Each function has a docstring placeholder explaining its purpose, and the main function is set up to start the game. The actual implementation of each function's logic will need to be completed as per the game's requirements and implementation plan.

 - The 'Snake2/Code/Snake.py' file has been rewritten to include the main function implementation, ensuring that the startup, execution, and shutdown of the game are properly handled. All called functions are now defined, and the program should run as coded.
