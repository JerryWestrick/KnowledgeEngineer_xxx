# Implementation Plan for Snake Game

## Overview
The implementation plan outlines the steps required to develop the Snake game based on the provided requirements. The plan will cover the development of game mechanics, user interface, and additional features such as difficulty levels and sound effects.

## Game Mechanics
- Implement the snake movement logic.
- Develop the food generation and consumption system.
- Create collision detection for walls and the snake's body.
- Program the logic for the snake's growth after eating food.
- Implement the game over condition.
- Introduce increasing speed levels as the snake consumes more food.

## User Interface
- Design and implement the game area.
- Create controls for the snake's direction using arrow keys.
- Develop the start, pause, and resume functionality.
- Display the current score on the screen.
- Implement the game over screen with restart and quit options.
- Add support for different difficulty levels.
- Record and display high scores.

## Additional Features
- Add special items with effects on the snake's length or score.
- Incorporate sound effects and music.
- Implement a countdown timer for added time pressure.

## Development Stages
1. Set up the project structure and basic game loop.
2. Implement the core game mechanics.
3. Develop the user interface and interaction controls.
4. Add additional features and difficulty levels.
5. Test the game thoroughly to ensure all mechanics and features work correctly.
6. Optimize performance and finalize the game for release.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
- Conduct unit testing for individual components.
